                               Sagar Roy is a 35 year old honest taxi driver from Kolkata. Entrepreneur at heart, Nithin always had a flair for keeping his customers loyal. Taking an innovative approach, he installed a Mifi in his taxi and offers free internet to his customers. Now his taxi is known as ‘wifi wali taxi’ and is in great demand.

                              The reason he says “Few years ago the traffic and pollution in this city got really bad. The travel time doubled because of traffic. This made my customers impatient and irritable. Around the same time people started becoming very sceptical about us drivers. So much so that even if I recommend a different & much quicker route, they pounce on me. ‘You are trying to cheat me’ they would say. I noticed that when my customers had access to internet on the ride, they were less aggressive. Since then, I wanted my cab to have internet (wifi) of its own”.

                                <p>
                                Earlier, customers used to constantly tell me to take a shortcut so that they can reach 2 minutes early. But now they tell me to take a longer route and sometimes they sit in the taxi even after reaching the destination to access free Internet.</p><p>Once, while I was dropping a customer to the airport he came to know that his flight to Chennai was delayed by 4 hours. He had already checked out of his hotel.
So I recommended him to see the Howrah Bridge. After all, how can someone come all the way to Kolkata and not see it? Till the time we reached the place, the customer knew exactly what he wanted to see and where he wanted to eat. All thanks to my Mifi.
