                             It was a fine morning when my squad and I were charged up to meet the days errands. It was an important day for our team as we had our final pitch planned for the evening. We had worked really hard on the campaign strategy to launch Jio.com since the last month and we were almost ready with the final presentation.

                                The only task that had to be completed before the pitch was to include reference pictures and video links in the presentation. Unlike any other day, there was a power failure in our office. All the systems were shut and there was no access to the internet. We enquired about the electricity and we got into a panic mode when we were informed that it would take atleast half a day.

                             <p class="showmore" id="showmore3"> We gathered at the conference room with our laptops. Deepak, my colleague brought a mysterious tiny black coloured device, which looked more or less like a pebble from the river beds. He switched it on, and we got access to high speed 4G connection. He was a saviour of the moment. The surprise didnâ€™t end there. All eight of our team members could connect to the Mi-fi device and the speeds were much faster than our office wifi. And yes, we got a green signal for the campaign.</p>
